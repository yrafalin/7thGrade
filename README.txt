# 7thGrade
These projects are my more succesful, and least buggy projects from 7th Grade, which was 2016-2017. In the first semester of the year I took an elective which taught me all about Python. Before Python, I had only done Scratch, a block-based language. My Python teacher was amazing. Over the course of that year I worked on a ton more projects at home, not just at school. My teacher also recommended a website to me, called Project Euler. Some of these projects are not only games, but also programs for some problems on Project Euler. Lastly, also remember these are not all my programs. I have many more stubs and buggier programs as well from 7th Grade. Also, one last teeny thing I wanted to say: Please remember that the Tic Tac Toe program, although it is pretty buggy, was my first big Python program, so I still decided to put it on here.
